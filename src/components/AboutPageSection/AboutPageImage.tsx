                Founded in 2010 by master perfumer Claire Laurent, ESSENCE began
                as a small atelier in<br></br> Paris dedicated to creating
                fragrances that capture the sublime beauty of natural elements.

                  With a background in traditional French perfumery and a
                  passion for sustainable practices, Claire set out to create a

                  precious natural resources that make it possible.
